Articulated Classification Rule:
The general rule for determining the classification is based on the emotional tone and outcome described in the text. Specifically:

- **Positive Classification**: The text describes events or experiences that evoke happiness, satisfaction, success, or joy. These texts often include words or phrases that convey positive emotions or successful outcomes, such as "wonderful," "amazing," "overjoyed," "priceless," "beautiful," "successfully," "joy," "loved," "free," "won," etc.

- **Negative Classification**: The text describes events or experiences that evoke sadness, frustration, disappointment, or loss. These texts often include words or phrases that convey negative emotions or unfortunate outcomes, such as "terrible," "broke down," "lost," "discouraged," "closed down," "cancel," "increased," "passed over," "ruined," "heartbroken," etc.

The classification is determined by identifying the overall sentiment of the situation described in the text. If the sentiment is predominantly positive, it is classified as positive; if it is predominantly negative, it is classified as negative.

Confidence Level: 95%

I chose this confidence level because the examples provided are clear and consistent in their emotional tone, making it relatively straightforward to determine the classification based on the presence of positive or negative sentiments. However, there is always a small margin for error due to potential nuances or mixed emotions in more complex texts.
