Success rate >= 90%, asking model to articulate classification rule...

Articulated Classification Rule:
The general rule for classification appears to be based on capitalization. Specifically, the classification is "true" if the text follows title case or sentence case with proper nouns and the first word capitalized, and "false" if the text is entirely in lowercase. 

In the examples provided:
- Texts classified as "true" have the first letter of each significant word capitalized, resembling title case or proper sentence case.
- Texts classified as "false" are entirely in lowercase, with no capital letters at the beginning of words.

Based on this pattern, my confidence in this rule is 100%. This is because all provided examples consistently follow this capitalization pattern, and there are no exceptions or additional factors influencing the classification.
