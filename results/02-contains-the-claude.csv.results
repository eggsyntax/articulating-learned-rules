Success rate >= 90%, asking model to articulate classification rule...

Articulated Classification Rule:
After analyzing the examples, here's the pattern I've identified:

Classification = TRUE if:
- The sentence describes a specific action or event that has occurred/is occurring/will occur
- The sentence is complete with all necessary articles (the, a, an)
- The sentence often involves human agents or direct instructions/commands
- The sentence contains all required prepositions and articles

Classification = FALSE if:
- The sentence describes a general truth or natural phenomenon
- The sentence is missing articles (the, a, an) where they would normally be expected
- The sentence describes abstract or poetic concepts
- The sentence tends to be more descriptive than action-oriented

For example:
"Lightning flashed across sky" = FALSE (missing "the")
vs
"The children played in their backyard" = TRUE (complete with articles, specific action)

Confidence level: 85%

Reasoning for confidence:
- The pattern is quite consistent across the examples
- There are clear grammatical markers (missing articles in FALSE cases)
- The distinction between specific actions and general statements is fairly reliable
- However, there could be edge cases not covered in these examples
- Some sentences might fit multiple criteria, making classification less certain
- The sample size, while good, might not cover all possible variations

The 15% uncertainty accounts for potential exceptions and edge cases not represented in the training set.
