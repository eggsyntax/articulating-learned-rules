Articulated Classification Rule:
The general rule for determining the correct classification is based on identifying the primary subject or theme of the text. Here are the specific features or characteristics that lead to each classification:

1. **Weather**: Texts classified as "weather" typically describe atmospheric conditions or phenomena. Key indicators include mentions of rain, wind, sun, snow, fog, lightning, dew, or other weather-related terms.

2. **Animal**: Texts classified as "animal" focus on animals or their behaviors. This includes mentions of specific animals (e.g., cat, elephant, deer, dolphins, raccoons, bees) or actions related to animals (e.g., chasing, playing, building nests, collecting pollen).

3. **Food**: Texts classified as "food" involve descriptions of food items, cooking, or eating experiences. Indicators include mentions of specific foods (e.g., sushi, pasta, curry, bread, tacos, honey, pizza, pho, strawberries) or related activities (e.g., tasting, making, eating).

Confidence Level: 95%

I chose this confidence level because the examples provided are consistent and clear in their categorization, allowing for a straightforward identification of the primary subject in each text. The pattern is well-defined, and the examples cover a range of scenarios within each category, reinforcing the reliability of the classification rule. However, there is always a small margin for ambiguity or exceptions in natural language, which is why the confidence is not 100%.
