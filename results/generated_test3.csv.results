Articulated Classification Rule:
The general rule for classification appears to be based on capitalization. Specifically, the text is classified as "true" if it follows title case, where the first letter of each major word is capitalized. Conversely, the text is classified as "false" if it is in all lowercase letters.

Key features for classification:
- "True" classification: The text is in title case, meaning the first letter of each significant word is capitalized. This includes the first word of the sentence and any subsequent nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
- "False" classification: The text is entirely in lowercase, with no capitalized letters at the beginning of any words.

Confidence level: 95%

Reason for confidence level: The pattern is consistent across all provided examples, with no exceptions. Each example follows the rule of title case for "true" and lowercase for "false." The only reason the confidence is not 100% is due to the possibility of encountering edge cases or exceptions not covered by the examples provided.
