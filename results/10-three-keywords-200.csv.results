Success rate >= 90%, asking model to articulate classification rule...

Articulated Classification Rule:
Based on the examples provided, the classification seems to depend on whether the text describes an action or change in state, particularly involving emotions, perceptions, or dynamic events, as opposed to static descriptions or metaphors. Here's the pattern I've identified:

1. **True Classification**: The text often involves:
   - An action or event occurring (e.g., "When the rain fell, they danced in it.")
   - A change in emotional or mental state (e.g., "He felt less tired after a nap.")
   - A dynamic or transitional moment (e.g., "When the clock struck twelve, the party began.")

2. **False Classification**: The text typically includes:
   - Static descriptions or metaphors (e.g., "The forest was a place of wonder.")
   - Descriptions of places or things without an action or change (e.g., "The river was a flowing ribbon.")

The new example, "When the music stopped, the silence was deafening," fits the pattern for a "true" classification because it describes a dynamic event (the stopping of music) and the resulting change in perception (the silence being deafening).

**Confidence Level**: 90%

I chose this confidence level because the pattern is consistent across the examples provided, with clear distinctions between dynamic actions or changes (classified as true) and static descriptions or metaphors (classified as false). However, there is always a possibility of exceptions or additional nuances not captured in the examples.
