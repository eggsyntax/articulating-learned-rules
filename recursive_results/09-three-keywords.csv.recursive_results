Recursive Classification Results

Model: gpt-4o
Test File: 09-three-keywords.csv
Using articulated rule:
The classification pattern appears to be based on the presence of certain keywords or structures in the text. Specifically:

1. **Classification: true** - The text often includes:
   - The word "less" indicating a reduction or comparison (e.g., "Less than five minutes remained").
   - A question or an implied question (e.g., "When will you be arriving at the airport?").
   - A temporal or conditional clause often starting with "when" (e.g., "When the alarm went off, she jumped out of bed").

2. **Classification: false** - The text typically describes a static or descriptive scene, action, or preference without the elements mentioned above (e.g., "The artist painted a beautiful landscape").

Based on these observations, the rule can be articulated as follows:
- Classify as "true" if the text contains the word "less," poses a question, or includes a temporal/conditional clause starting with "when."
- Classify as "false" if the text is a straightforward description or statement without these elements.
